I find this piece to be very interesting, as it plays with the way we see things, our perception of color and the definition of the screens. I find the ability to zoom into artwork very revealing. The colors on the wheel are created by sending a search query to Bing using color terms. While some of the colors return standard images, the author notes that blue and violet yield inappropriate imagery. The original piece is a 54’’ by 54’’ archival print, but online the user automatically zooms into the images.

This is a project available on Flickr. The author recorded the last 256 clicks, specifically the small window around the point where the mouse was clicked. This images were then connected into one image. I found this project to be very interesting, as it explores our behavior as a user, and can reveal some patterns. I also think that it would be interesting to repeat the experiment and see whether different users would get significantly different results. Unfortunately, there is no interactive part beyond creation of these.

This is an artwork originally created in ActionScript. As described by the author, “Audio responsive video exploration, based on audio input, randomness and mouse gestures.”. Therefore, the original video was created as a response to the sound and mouse movements, and at the end we get this amazing cartoon, with interesting geometric transformations. I think that this is a good example of the possibilities for the interactive animation that I find especially appealing.
