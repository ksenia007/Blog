# Week 2 Blog Post

As inspiration for the future graphics projects I selected some artworks that I enjoyed a lot.

I find this piece to be very interesting, as it plays with the way we see things, our perception of color and the definition of the screens. I find the ability to zoom into artwork very revealing. The colors on the wheel are created by sending a search query to Bing using color terms. While some of the colors return standard images, the author notes that blue and violet yield inappropriate imagery. The original piece is a 54’’ by 54’’ archival print, but online the user automatically zooms into the images. 

## Important Things

This is a project available on Flickr. The author recorded the last 256 clicks, specifically the small window around the point where the mouse was clicked. This images were then connected into one image. I found this project to be very interesting, as it explores our behavior as a user, and can reveal some patterns. I also think that it would be interesting to repeat the experiment and see whether different users would get significantly different results. Unfortunately, there is no interactive part beyond creation of these. 

## Flightpattern

This is an artwork originally created in ActionScript. As described by the author, “Audio responsive video exploration, based on audio input, randomness and mouse gestures.”. Therefore, the original video was created as a response to the sound and mouse movements, and at the end we get this amazing cartoon, with interesting geometric transformations. I think that this is a good example of the possibilities for the interactive animation that I find especially appealing. 


# Week 3 Blog Post

For my "hello world" works, I created two animations. One is a simple square and lines, and the other one is stars appearing and forming 'hello world':

   <img src="/images/rec.gif" width="350"/>

I really enjoyed the process of creating these pieces. I spent the most time of the starry sky, specifically the animation and updating the star locations. This is still work in progress, as I will need to change the way the star locations are saved and processed. It would also be better to make a separate function for drawing the stars from the array. I am still a little confused about the best way to create animations in p5.js. To continue the work I plan to read the Creative coding in p5.js book and practice more with the animation. I also hope to look at the tutorials from the Nature of Code examples for p5js.
